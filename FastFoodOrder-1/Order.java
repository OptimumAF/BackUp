/* An order represents the order a customer builds and the employee enters into a POS system. Here's what we should include on it:

a static variable that keeps track of the order number that increments with each new order created

a subtotal that keeps a running total of the order cost

an ArrayList that stores the MenuItems in the current order

methods that allow adding/removing from the order, should also update the subtotal

method that prints the entire order summary, including the order number, subtotal and final total after 8.375% sales tax is applied
